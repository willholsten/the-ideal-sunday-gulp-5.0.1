        "text": "<p>The Ideal Sunday started with a walk in the woods with a couple of friends on a sunny December afternoon. Inspired by the environment around us, and my new reusable coffee cup, I decided to start a company that helped connect regular people like us with awesome eco-friendly products.Â <\/p><p>The thought was simple - with small changes, we could change the world, without changing too much about our lives. A couple of months later - and just a few weeks before we catapulted into a global pandemic - Iâ€™d left my job (oops!), built our website (wahoo!) and filled my little flat with the beginnings of our small but perfectly formed product line.<\/p><p>Weâ€™re called The Ideal Sunday in honour of that afternoon.Â Â Itâ€™s stuck around because we like it, and because it means something different to everyone. My ideal Sunday is about exercise, some delicious food, a walk in the woods. Yours could be a game of footy, a hungover breakfast, or an unprecedented lie-in without your kids!Â <\/p><p>Whatever it is, we want to help you enjoy it even more, by adding that feel-good factor of knowing youâ€™re taking a step towards a greener future. So go ahead and check out our blog and products, and hopefully youâ€™ll pick up some new ideas. Weâ€™re a place to learn, share and shop responsibly. You donâ€™t have to change what you love, but maybe you can make it better ðŸ’š<\/p><p>Will - Founder of The Ideal Sunday<\/p>",
